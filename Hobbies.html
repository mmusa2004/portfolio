				<span>The best part about incorporating a morning walk into your daily routine is how easily it can be done. <br/><br/>There is no expensive fitness center membership to be bought and no major rejigging of your schedule required; all it takes for you to get started on your morning walks is some motivation and a good pair of trainers! So, are you all set to shake off your sedentary sloth and join the morning walker brigade?<br/><br/>According to the American Heart Association, you can reduce your risk of getting heart disease and stroke by walking briskly for 30 minutes every day. That's all it takes to lower blood pressure, reduce triglyceride levels and harmful LDL cholesterol. In fact, this golden half an hour of morning exercise four or five times a week can keep you safe from strokes as well, says a report by the University of South Carolina.</span>
